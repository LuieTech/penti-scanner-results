CloudSploit scans cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and GCP for security misconfigurations. 
It checks for risks like publicly exposed resources, weak IAM settings, missing encryption, 
and compliance gaps. We ran a scan in local test mode using the built-in “security” collection 
and saved the results in cloudsploit-results.json.
